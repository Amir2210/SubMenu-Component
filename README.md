🎉 Welcome to the SubMenu Component 🚀

These React component, SubMenu, is essential parts of a user interface designed to provide navigation and interaction features. Let's explore their functionality and usage!

📦 Tech Stack:
* React.js
* AppContext (Custom Context)

👩🏽‍🍳 Features:
App Context:
* Global State Management: Manages the state of the sidebar's visibility and link hover status using a custom global context.
* Event Handlers: Provides functions for toggling the sidebar, handling link hover events, and closing the sidebar.

Components:
* Nav Component: Renders the main navigation bar of the application.
* SubMenu Component: Displays a submenu or dropdown menu for additional navigation options.
* Sidebar Component: Renders a sidebar for secondary navigation and content.

💭 Process:
* Context Creation: Established a global context using createContext and custom hooks (useGlobalContext) to access and modify the global state.
* State Management: Utilized useState hooks to manage the state of the sidebar's visibility and link hover status.
* Component Composition: Integrated the Nav, SubMenu, and Sidebar components into the main App component to build the application layout.

📚 Learnings:
* Gained experience in using React context for global state management, improving component communication and reusability.
* Practiced integrating multiple components to create a cohesive user interface with dynamic navigation features.
✨ Improvements:
While the current version of the components and context setup is functional, there are opportunities for improvement:

* Component Refinement: Enhance the visual design and layout of the components for better aesthetics and user experience.
* State Optimization: Optimize state management techniques to minimize unnecessary re-renders and improve performance.
* Accessibility: Ensure accessibility standards are met for users with disabilities, including keyboard navigation and screen reader compatibility.
